/*
So basically for the authentication I will basically basically there will be a home page.
So in the homepage there can be some faqs page like we can say our policies and login/signup button
policies button will take us to the rules and regulation of the business and basically it is static
we can use create this page at the build time as there is no dynamic data. and login page basically
will redirect to the login page. This page will be client side as we need user input but all the api
calls will be made on the server only so that when we recieve token and other sensitive info.

on this login page we can pre select existing user we can give radio button. and if the person select 
new user than we can add few more things in the form component for additional details.
