Sources for Introducing Hooks
=====================================

Definition:
React **Hooks** were introduced in **React 16.8** to allow functional components to use state, 
lifecycle methods, and other React features without using class components.

-------------------------------------
Key Points:
-------------------------------------
1. Official React documentation and blog posts announced Hooks.  
2. RFC (Request for Comments) process proposed hooks before release.  
3. React team introduced hooks to solve problems of:
   - Reusing stateful logic (without HOCs or render props).  
   - Reducing complexity of class components.  
   - Avoiding `this` binding issues.  

-------------------------------------
Guidelines:
-------------------------------------
- Learn Hooks from **React official documentation** (reactjs.org).  
- Follow **Hooks API reference** for `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.  
- Refer to **React blog posts** for motivation and mental model explanations.  

-------------------------------------
Example:
-------------------------------------
// No code required; this is conceptual knowledge.
// Suggested sources:
1. React Official Docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
2. React Blog: https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/06/react-v16.7.0.html
3. RFC: https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0006-hooks.md

-------------------------------------
Analogy:
-------------------------------------
- Hooks were like **upgrading a toolkit**: functional components now have the same abilities 
  as class components without extra setup.
