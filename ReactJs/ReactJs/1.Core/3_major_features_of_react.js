How to speak in interview:
"React’s major features are: 
component-based architecture, 
virtual DOM for performance, 
declarative UI, declarative means we decribe that how ui should like not how to build it step
by step,
one-way data flow, 
JSX for writing UI, 
hooks for state and lifecycle, 
and a strong ecosystem with tools like React Router and Redux."

-----------------------------------
Major Features of React:

1. Component-Based:
- UI is broken into small, reusable pieces called components.  
- Each component manages its own logic and rendering.  

2. Virtual DOM:
- React uses a virtual copy of the DOM.  
- It updates only the parts of the UI that change.  
- This makes rendering fast and efficient.  

3. Declarative UI:
- You describe what the UI should look like for a given state.  
- React automatically updates the DOM when state changes.  

4. Unidirectional Data Flow:
- Data flows in one direction (parent → child).  
- This makes apps predictable and easier to debug.  

5. JSX:
- A syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript.  
- Makes UI code more readable and expressive.  

6. React Hooks:
- Allow using state and lifecycle features in functional components.  
- Examples: useState, useEffect, useContext.  

7. Strong Ecosystem:
- React works with libraries like Redux, React Router, Next.js, etc.  
- Supports web, mobile (React Native), and even desktop apps.
